# Modular Navigation with Deep Linking

This repository is a simplified example of dynamic and decentralized 
deep linking navigation in Android applications.

It utilizes Dagger to provide a Set of `DeeplinkProcessor`s which are 
capable of matching and processing certain `deeplinks` - and execute 
the associated navigation actions.
